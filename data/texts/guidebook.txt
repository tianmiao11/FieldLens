Maize lodging should immediately be sprayed with 0.2% potassium dihydrogen phosphate + 0.1% zinc sulfate solution to enhance stalk toughness and prevent secondary breakage.
Lodged maize needs to be manually straightened on the same day, with 6-8 cm soil cultivation at the base, and 3-4 plants tied together to avoid further stalk damage.
Broken-stalk lodged maize should be promptly removed from the field to prevent rot disease transmission affecting surrounding healthy plants.
After lodging, apply 15-20 jin of urea + 2 kg of potassium dihydrogen phosphate per mu to promote rapid recovery of root system and new leaf growth.
Maize seedling yellowing requires 0.2% zinc sulfate solution supplementation, as zinc participates in chlorophyll synthesis to promote new leaf greening and recovery.
Malnourished maize should be sprayed with 1% urea + 0.5% potassium dihydrogen phosphate mixture to rapidly supplement macro-nutrients for growth promotion.
Weak growth at jointing stage can be sprayed with 0.5% calcium nitrate + 0.2% magnesium sulfate solution, as calcium and magnesium enhance stalk toughness and prevent lodging.
At large trumpet stage, spray potassium dihydrogen phosphate + humic acid + borax mixture to promote female ear differentiation and improve pollination success rate.
Trace elements zinc and boron should be applied separately - zinc fertilizer at 7-9 leaf stage and boron fertilizer at ear stage, with significant yield increase effects.
Maize fertilization requires nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium ratio of 3.5:1:1.4, with 2.5kg nitrogen, 0.7kg phosphorus and 1.0kg potassium needed per 100kg grain yield.
Base fertilizer should apply 2000kg decomposed farm manure + 50kg compound fertilizer per mu, with 20cm deep plowing to improve soil structure and fertility.
Seedling fertilizer should apply 5-8kg urea at 3-5 leaf stage, accounting for 30-40% of total nitrogen to establish high-yield foundation.
Ear fertilizer should apply 15-20kg urea at large trumpet stage, accounting for 50% of total nitrogen during critical period for female ear differentiation.
Grain fertilizer should spray 0.2% potassium dihydrogen phosphate + 0.1% urea solution during grain filling to extend leaf function period and increase grain weight.
Combine organic and inorganic fertilizers, with base fertilizer providing 50-60% nutrients and precise top-dressing supplementing each growth stage to prevent premature aging.
3-5 leaf stage is the optimal herbicide window - use 75ml of 4% nicosulfuron mixed with 30kg water for thorough uniform spraying.
Pre-emergence soil sealing can use 100ml of 50% acetochlor mixed with 40kg water for effective grass weed control.
Post-emergence herbicide application should avoid high-temperature windy weather, ensuring no overlap or missed spots for uniform weed control without crop damage.
Two-spotted armyworm control can use chlorpyrifos mixed with wheat bran as poison bait applied along ridges at maize seedling base in evening for effective control.
Corn borer control should spray 1% emamectin benzoate 500x solution at heart leaf late stage, focusing on maize ear and stem base pest control.
Large and small leaf spot disease should spray 50% carbendazim 500x solution at initial infection, repeating every 7 days for 2-3 consecutive treatments.
Seed treatment should use thiamethoxam + chlorantraniliprole coating to prevent underground pests and seedling diseases, ensuring uniform and robust seedlings.
Compact maize varieties should have 4500-5500 plants/mu density, while spreading varieties 3000-3800 plants/mu for reasonable density and high yield promotion.
Wide-narrow row planting with 70cm wide rows and 35cm narrow rows, 20cm plant spacing at 5800 plants/mu density for high-yield efficiency and good ventilation.
Sowing depth should be 3-5cm for uniform emergence - too deep causes emergence difficulty, too shallow causes moisture loss affecting uniform seedling establishment.
Soil temperature at 5cm depth should stabilize at 10-12°C for sowing - too early risks frost damage, too late affects growth period and yield.
Critical water periods for maize are large trumpet stage and tasseling stage - irrigate promptly during drought and drain waterlogging promptly.
Maintain soil moisture during grain filling to prevent premature aging, control water appropriately during maturity to promote ripening and improve grain plumpness and quality.
Biostimulant foliar fertilizers regulate plant physiological metabolism to enhance stress resistance and growth vitality.
Foliar fertilizers containing humic acid, seaweed extract and amino acids can improve maize growing environment, enhance stress resistance, and promote root development and leaf greening.
Hormonal foliar fertilizers regulate plant endogenous hormone levels to promote growth.
Spraying hormonal foliar fertilizers containing gibberellin and indole acetic acid can stimulate maize growth potential and promote rapid recovery. However, hormonal foliar fertilizers should be used appropriately to avoid abnormal growth from excessive application.
Foliar fertilizer application timing should preferably be morning or evening when temperature is lower and light intensity is weaker, facilitating foliar absorption. Avoid application during high temperature, strong light, rainy or windy conditions to prevent fertilizer loss or leaf burn.
Follow foliar fertilizer instructions for dilution according to recommended concentrations. Excessive concentration may burn leaves, while insufficient concentration reduces effectiveness. Therefore, strictly follow proportions during dilution to ensure appropriate fertilizer concentration.
3-5 leaf stage is the optimal herbicide application window. At this stage, maize has strong herbicide tolerance and weeds are tender, providing significant control effects. Missing this period increases weed resistance and maize herbicide damage risk.
Herbicides: Single formulations: 4% nicosulfuron SC (100-120ml/mu), 25% mesotrione SC (100ml/mu); Compound formulations: 30% mesotrione·nicosulfuron·atrazine SC (120-150ml/mu) for broad-spectrum control with extended duration.
Fungicides: 25% pyraclostrobin SC (20ml/mu) + 70% thiophanate-methyl WP (50g/mu) for root disease prevention.
Insecticides: 10% imidacloprid WP (15g/mu) for piercing-sucking pest control.
